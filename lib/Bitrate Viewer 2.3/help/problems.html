		<li>Error tolerance of the tool is not perfect. The MPEG standard is
			often misused. Therefore many files out there maybe corrupt and not
			perfectly tracked. In either cases it is only the frame count
			estimation that can't read out a frame rate -or-, which is worse
			than that, the frame reader which is implemented by FFMpeg
			crashes.<br>
			In the latter case i.e. if you get the Windows' crash message,
			please report the file of suspect to the author - maybe it can get
			fixed.</li>
		<li>Due to the limited error tolerance mentioned above it may happen
			that the tool loops infinitely. You may have a chance to press the
			stop button. If you do so the program's calculation thread will be
			stopped unconditionally. This can lead to unpredictable results due
			to memory leaks, locked DLL's, etc. Even if you can continue
			working with the tool on other files you should restart it and also
			report the causing file to the author to fix the problem.</li>
		<li>MPEG elementary streams (ES) whose origin are e.g. DVD recorders
			in Panasonic VRO format may have a wrong frame count estimation.<br>
			This can't be fixed unless the tool would read the file of interest
			twice - and surely that's not what you really want it to!</li>
		<li>You may get a higher frame count estimated on transport streams
			than the tool can really demux after that step when bringing those
			frames into the display. This can be caused by transport errors in
			the stream so that some frames may be damaged ... but these damages
			are not counted in the PTS markers in the file from which the frame
			count is calculated. This is a problem which cannot be fixed.</li>
