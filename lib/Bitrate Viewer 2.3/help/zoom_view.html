		<h2>Multi-zoom mode</h2>
	</div>

	<div id="wrap-image-right">

	</div>

	<p>This feature has been added since Bitrate Viewer Version 2.0 - zoom a
		marked area within the viewer window several times downto a single
		sample depth view. To start a zoom just <i>LeftClick</i> and drag an
		area of your needs (see right-hand screenshot). Small tick marks as you
		can see on the screenshot are not displayed in the standard non-zoomed view
		except you move the mouse pointer within a small band at the top of the
		view. The tick marks are placed at every 5% of the views width of which
		every 25% is somewhat bigger than the others. Thus may allow you a more
		precise placement of your zoom. Notice if this is your first zoom you want
		to apply on a view you will see a zoom indicator bar below the bottom of
		the viewer window. A red blinking bull-eye will show you the percentage of
		the view currently covered.</p>

	<p>To adjust your selection of the zoomable area hold <i>Shift-RightMouseButton</i>
		down and drag the area to your size as you want it. Hold <i>Ctrl-RightMouseButton</i>
		down within the marked zoomable area you move the area along the viewer
		window. Note that the percentage value displayed centered to the zoomable
		area is based on the width of the viewer window in pixels.</p>

	<p>Now when you're done with you selection of a zoomable area use a
		<i>RightClick</i> into this area just marked and displayed and the
		tool will enter the zoom. Several things will happen now: The most
		important thing of course is, that the view is zoomed to your selection
		and now shows the amount of bitrate samples that lie between start and
		end of your selection.</p>

	<div class="clear">
		<p><u><strong>Note</strong></u>: If you want to exit your current selection,
		<i>LeftClick</i> once anywhere into the viewer window to cancel the
		selection.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="wrap-image-left">
		<img src="images/BitrateViewer-Zoomed1.png" width="573" height="302">
	</div>

	<p>The zoom indicator below the viewer window shows an orange colored
		fixed bull-eye which indicated the width in percent of the amount
		of bitrate samples currently displayed vs. its total amount.</p>

	<p>An additional zoom flag is displayed right-hand beneath the total
		time value on the right hand side of the GUI. It indicates that the
		view is shown with an active zoom and optional the depth number of
		zooming is appended. You can switch between standard and extended
		display of the zoom flag with <i>RightClick</i>.</p>

	<p>In the headline of the viewer window you'll see a status on its right
		side containing the amount of bitrate samples currently displayed
		vs. its total amount, the duration in hh:mm:ss:mil of the zoom
		covered and the percentage of the bitrate samples (current vs.
		total). The latter may differ and is mostly less than the percentage
		displayed when you've selected the zoomable are before. The pixel
		values of the viewer window needn't match accurately to the amount
		of bitrate samples. Some specialities occur for the frame analysis
		method: The headline will show the frame number your mouse tracked
		cursor is currently pointing to and the term samples here is identical
		to frames. Note that the frame number starts with the value 1.<br>
		For the other analysis methods the current sample number is displayed
		in the headline. Sample numbers also start with the value 1.</p>

	<div class="clear">
		<h2>Advanced zoom features</h2>
	</div>

	<p>Note that when your zoomed area does not cover the <strong>minimum</strong>
		and/or <strong>maximum bitrate values</strong> with their markers, an
		arrow of the same color as the missing non-displayed marker is displayed
		indicating the direction to the true position of the missing item.</p>

	<div id="wrap-image-right">
		<img src="images/BitrateViewer-PreJumpZoom.png" width="573" height="302">
	</div>

	<p>If the missing minimum and maximum bitrate values both lie on the same
		direction out of the view the longer arrow indicates that its position
		is farther outward than the other one. As you can see on the screenshot
		beneath these arrows are working like hyperlinks. Once you <i>LeftClick</i>
		on either one the zoomed view will be moved around the minimum or maximum
		bitrate position you've selected and if possible the selected item will
		be centered within the viewer window. The scale of the moved zoom view
		will remain the same across minimum and maximum bitrate jumps. By the way
		the zoom depth value of the zoom flag (right hand to the total time value
		display) won't change because the scale of the view is the same after
		re-positioning.</p>

	<p>Beneath zooming around the minimum or maximum bitrate marker you have two
		more possibilities to move to another position and zoom with the same
		scale as the current zoom is displayed (so the depth value of the zoom
		flag also doesn't change):</p>

	<ul class="diamond" style="margin-top:0px; margin-left:599px;">
		<li class="block"><b>Jump to direct neighbour</b>:<br>
			Use the zoom indicator below the viewer window and <i>LeftClick</i>
			beneath the orange bull-eye either left or right to it. The zoom is
			moved directly to its left or right border, including the border
			sample value as the previous or next starting point.</li>
		<li class="block"><strong>Global drag and move zoom area</strong>:<br>
			Again use the zoom indicator here and <i>Ctrl-LeftClick</i>
			anywhere on the indicator and drag/move the bull-eye to the target
			position of the complete file you want it to. The new zoomed view
			is centered around the middle of the bull-eye's position related
			to the full view of the whole file.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="clear">
		<h2>Changing the zoom scale</h2>
	</div>

	<p>The remaining zoom manipulations will all change the scale of the
		resulting zoom display and so the amount of bitrates on the viewer
		window will be different to the previous zoomed display. So here we have:</p>

	<ul class="diamond">
		<li class="block"><b>Zoom to one sample per display unit at place</b>:<br>
			This one can only be applied to the standard non-zoomed display.
			With <i>Ctrl-Alt-Shift-RightClick</i> within the viewer window a
			scale will be calculated that results in one measure sample per
			display unit, i.e. per pixel of the display width. The current
			cursor position on init of the zoom will be centered on the
			resulting displayed zoom. If this zoom feature was successfully
			applied you'll get specific detail information on each single
			sample displayed on screen while moving the cursor over the viewer
			window.</li>
		<li class="block"><strong>Zoom in +50% at place (expand view)</strong>:<br>
			The zoom-in feature is applicable on an existing zoomed display
			unless the zoom scale is not already too deep. Use a
			<i>Ctrl-Shift-RightClick</i> within the viewer window to get the
			display zoomed in at half of its current amount of samples. The
			current cursor position will be centered on the resulting
			displayed zoom.</li>
		<li class="block"><strong>Zoom out -200% at place (shrink view)</strong>:<br>
			The zoom-out feature is applicable on an existing zoomed display.
			use a <i>Ctrl-Alt-RightClick</i> within the viewer window to get
			the display zoomed out at double of its current amount of samples.
			The current cursor position will be centered on the resulting
			displayed zoom. If the resulting scale can't be doubled the zoom
			mode will be exited and you'll get the standard non-zoomed
			display in this case.</li>
		<li class="block"><strong>Continous zoom-in at place</strong>:<br>
			With <i>Ctrl-Shift-LeftClick</i> within the viewer window you
			start a new or continue an existing automatic zoom which will
			be automatically continued as long as you keep the mouse button
			and the key modifiers pressed. The first zoom step that is done
			here will catch the current mouse pointer position and try to
			center the bitrate sample value pointed on. The repetition time
			interval is constant and the scale factor for the zoom increases
			by a natural exponentional function. This zoom feature stops when
			the maximum scaling depth is on screen. You can start this zoom
			feature even from a non-zoomed (standard) displayed view.<br>
			As of version 2.1 you can also use the mouse wheel for this feature
			which might be more convenient for you. Like with a camera pull the
			wheel down to yourself to initiate a zoom or expand an existing zoom
			and therefore zoom into the display.</li>
		<li class="block"><strong>Continous zoom-out at place</strong>:<br>
			With <i>Ctrl-Alt-LeftClick</i> within the viewer window you'll
			begin to zoom out from any zoomed displayed view that will be
			continued automatically. During the first zoom step the bitrate
			sample value the mouse cursor is pointing on will be centered
			on screen as long you keep the mouse button pressed and the key
			modifiers held down while at the same time zooming in will
			continue until you release the mouse button. The repetition time
			interval here is also constant with a decreasing zoom scale
			factor based on a natural exponential funtion. You will notice
			a short pause when the last possible zoom scaling value is
			acquired after which the view will be switched back to the
			non-zoomed standard view mode. Thus you can't apply this zoom
			feature to the non-zoomed standard display.<br>
			As of version 2.1 you can do it with the mouse wheel. Like with
			a camera push the wheel up and away from yourself to shrink an
			existing zoom or to exit from a zoom and therefore zoom out of
			the display.</li>
