	<p>This tool is functionally derived and rewritten from DVD-Lab PRO's
		integrated Bitrate Viewer with some additional enhancements and
		specials.
	</p>

	<p>The main concept of this tool is to analyze all MPEG material from
		which you can create DVD's directly with a DVD authoring tool and
		draw a graphical histogram from analysis. So it should be able to
		read all files that include a video track and that you can
		use as assets for an authoring tool. With the graphical output you
		can easily view the quality of your video files before you're
		outputting it to a DVD and so save a lot of money by avoiding the
		production of any bad stuff. That's the main reason Bitrate
		Viewer is written for.	</p>

	<p>Because the main interface to read and analyze MPEG frames is based
		on the (L)GPL FFMpeg library the tool can also read, analyze and
		display many other video codecs than MPEG1 and MPEG2. But don't
		complain if you supply a file other than the main types MPEG1 and
		MPEG2 in the case of not working or even crashing. This may happen from
		time to time.</p>

	<p>A second interface for reading MPEG's is integrated and used in Bitrate
		Viewer whose reason for existence is the pre-estimation of the frame
		count for an MPEG file just opened without reading it completely. This
		interface only treats MPEG1 and MPEG2 file types. When you open such a
		file, this interface estimates the frame count prior to the analysis so
		the tool can do a proper preview while reading and analyzing the rest
		of it - in most cases.</p>

	<p>You may find especially Panasonic's VRO demuxed files or other MPEG
		files with bad timestamps within. These markers will cause a bad frame
		count estimation. In those cases the preview will be bad scaled until
		the file is completely read.</p>

	<p>There are many different MPEG encoders out there and also many
		possibilities to interpret ISO/IEC MPEG specifications. Therefore it
		is a high level task to calculate or estimate the frame count of an
		MPEG file prior reading it completely. Basically the frame count
		estimation algorithm is optimized to finish its job within a second or
		less. On MPEG1/MPEG2 ES and PES files this can be accomplished normally
		within some hundred milliseconds (if you have the file of interest on a
		standard hard drive that can read at appropriate speed). If you open
		VOB files it may take longer than a second - but up to now it didn't
		ever exceed two seconds.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile there are implemented a lot of commands to control the tool's
		GUI - so for a complete quick overwiew please read the
		<a href="commands.html">commands section</a>.</p>
