		<h2>Interface settings</h2>
	</div>

	<p>There are really only some parameters you can change within the
		interface's work - but in some cases these may reflect a major
		difference in the working performance of the tool.<br>
		With standard settings a full video frame reader will be activated for
		input file upto a size of 10MiB (+10% tolerance). The full read of
		those files is assumed to be quick enough to get not registered by the
		user for the time while the tool estimates the frame count of the input
		file after opening it. If you feel that this primary read takes to much
		time on your system or if your input source is a CD or DVD then you can
		either deactivate using the full video frame reader or change the
		threshold of the buffer size in percent upto the tool chooses full
		reading of a file.</p>

	<p><u><i>Hint</i></u>: The full video frame reader is always inactive when
		working on VOB files!<br>
		The internal threshold is automatically increased by 40% if the input
		file is a transport stream. That's because TS has some more overhead of
		MPEG headers. Generally you will see that the performance in analysis
		of transport streams is remarkable worse than on elementary or program
		streams. The reason is that two stacked demuxers will be used to get
		the video data of a stream and that gives a lot of packet overhead.</p>

	<h2>Online version check</h2>

	<p>Since Bitrate Viewer Version 1.0.3 an automatic online version check is
		done regularly. The default setting is an automatic check every three
		weeks. You can change the time interval of automatic checks within the
		<i>"Properties..."</i> sub-dialog. This dialog can be invoked e.g. by
		pressing <i>Ctrl-O</i>. There you can also deactivate this feature if
		you don't want having an internet connection activated by the tool.
		When you have to pass a proxy/firewall to access the internet, please
		specify the appropriate settings also in this sub-dialog. An optional
		password to access a proxy server via an user account will be stored
		within Windows registry as a DES-encrypted string.</p>

	<p>If a new version of Bitrate Viewer is available you will be alerted by
		a verbose version information window and you can access the online
		changelog page with download links directly.</p>

	<p>Even if you have the automatic online version check deactivated you can
		manually perform a version check by pressing <i>Ctrl-U</i>.</p>

	<h2>Minimum system requirements</h2>

	<ul class="diamond">
		<li>PC compatible with Intel Pentium 5 / 850 MHz and up or AMD equivalent</li>
		<li>Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003 Server, Windows Vista, Windows 7</li>
		<li>256 MB RAM, preferably more</li>
		<li>12 MB free disk space and as much as you need for your movie files
			to be analyzed</li>
